        <p class="innfo">   Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor.
            It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called 
            Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. These are not identical twins,
            however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.<br><br>
              Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually
            shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway
            greenhouse effect.<br> <br>
             It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is
            closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit
            (475 degrees Celsius).<br> <br>
             The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely 
            crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s possible
            some volcanoes are still active.
            <br><br>Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more
            than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the pressure you'd encounter a mile below the
            ocean on Earth.<br><br></p><img class="venus1picture" src="Sun_animated2.gif" alt="venus" >
            
            <p class="innfo">Another big difference from Earth – Venus rotates on its axis backward, compared to 
            most of the other planets in the solar system. It’s not the only planet in our solar
            system with such an oddball rotation – Uranus spins on its side.<br><br>
            Venus was the first planet to be explored by a spacecraft–NASA’s Mariner 2<br> <br>
            successfully flew by and scanned the cloud-covered world on Dec. 14, 1962. 
            Since then,
            numerous spacecraft from the U.S. and other space agencies have explored Venus, 
            including NASA’s Magellan, which mapped the planet's surface with radar. <br><br>
            Soviet spacecraft made the most successful landings on the surface of Venus to date,
            but they didn’t survive long due to the extreme heat and crushing pressure.<br><br>
            An American probe, one of NASA's Pioneer Venus Multiprobes, survived for about an hour
            after impacting the surface in 1978.</p>
            <img class="venus1picture" src="coolSun.jpg" alt="venus"><br>
            <p class="innfo">  NASA’s Parker Solar Probe has made multiple flybys of Venus. On Feb. 9, 2022, NASA 
            announced the spacecraft had captured its first visible light images of the surface 
            of Venus from space during its February 2021 flyby.

          <td class = "cell"><b>STAR ATTRACTION</b><br><br>
            The Sun is the only star in our solar system. It is the center of our solar system, and its gravity holds the solar system together. Everything in our solar system revolves around it – the planets, asteroids, comets, and tiny bits of space debris.</td>
          <td class="cell"><b>SUN DAY</b><br><br>
            Measuring a “day” on the Sun is complicated because of the way it rotates. It doesn't spin as a single, solid ball. This is because the Sun’s surface isn't solid like Earth's. Instead, the Sun is made of super-hot, electrically charged gas called plasma. This plasma rotates at different speeds on different parts of the Sun. At its equator, the Sun completes one rotation in 25 Earth days. At its poles, the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.</td>
          <td class="cell"><b>WALKING ON SUNSHINE</b><br><br>
            The part of the Sun we see from Earth – the part we call the surface – is the photosphere. The Sun doesn’t actually have a solid surface because it’s a ball of plasma.</td>

          DYNAMIC ATMOSPHERE
        </b><br><br>
        Above the Sun’s surface are its thin chromosphere and the huge corona (crown). This is where we see features such as solar prominences, flares, and coronal mass ejections. The latter two are giant explosions of energy and particles that can reach Earth.
      </td>
          <td class="cell"><b>MOONLESS</b><br><br>
            The Sun doesn’t have moons, but it’s orbited by eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, tens of thousands of asteroids, and perhaps three trillion comets and icy bodies.</td>

            STARGAZERS
          </b><br><br>
          Several spacecraft are currently investigating the Sun including Parker Solar Probe, STEREO, Solar Orbiter, SOHO, Solar Dynamics Observatory, Hinode, IRIS, and Wind.</td>

        <tr>
        <td class = "cell"><b>SUN DUST</b><br><br>
          The Sun would have been surrounded by a disk of gas and dust early in its history when the solar system was first forming 4.6 billion years ago. Some of that dust is still around today, in several dust rings that circle the Sun. They trace the orbits of planets, whose gravity tugs dust into place around the Sun. </td>
       <td class="cell"><b>SOURCE OF LIFE</b><br><br>
        Nothing could live on the Sun, but its energy is vital for most life on Earth.</td>
      <td class="cell"><b>
        HOT PROPERTY</b><br><br>
        The temperature in the Sun's core is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius) – hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion. This creates outward pressure that supports the star's gigantic mass, keeping it from collapsing.
