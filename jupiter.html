        <p class="innfo"> Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when 
          Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see
          the universe. <br><br>
          Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system –
          more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
            <br> <br>
            Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and
water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot 
is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.
            <br><br>
            One spacecraft – NASA's Juno orbiter – is currently exploring this giant world.

            Eleven Earths could fit across Jupiter’s equator. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be the size of a basketball.

          <td class="cell"><b>FIFTH PLANET FROM OUR STAR</b><br><br>
            Jupiter orbits about 484 million miles (778 million kilometers) or 5.2 Astronomical Units (AU) from our Sun (Earth is one AU from the Sun).
        </td>
          <td class="cell"><b>SHORT DAY/LONG YEAR</b><br><br>
            Jupiter rotates once about every 10 hours (a Jovian day), but takes about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun (a Jovian year).
