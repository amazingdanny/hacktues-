    Queqiao relay satellite also known as the Chang'e  4 Relay, is a communications relay
and radio astronomy satellite for the Chang'e 4 lunar farside mission. As part of the 
Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) launched
the Queqiao relay satellite on 20 May 2018 to a halo orbit around the Earthâ€“Moon L2 
Lagrangian point Queqiao is the first ever communication relay and radio astronomy 
satellite at this location.
    The name Queqiao ("Magpie Bridge") was inspired by and came from the Chinese tale The
Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.
