        <p class="LongText">  The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only 
            slightly larger than Earth's Moon.<br><br>
            From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as
            it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times 
            brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our 
            solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
            <br> <br>
            Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, 
            the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's
            surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset.

            volcanic vent located to the northeast of Rachmaninoff basin and west of Copland 
            crater.

            Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system – traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second. The closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it travels. Since Mercury is the fastest planet and has the shortest distance to travel around the Sun, it has the shortest year of all the planets in our solar system – 88 days.
