        <p class="LongText"> Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar 
            system. <br><br>
            Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. 
            It is not the only planet to have rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none
            are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.
            <br> <br>
            Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and 
            helium.

            Nine Earths side by side would almost span Saturn’s diameter. That doesn’t include Saturn’s rings.
        </td>
          <td class="cell"><b>IN DIM LIGHT</b><br><br>
            Saturn is the sixth planet from our Sun (a star) and orbits at a distance of about 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) from the Sun.
        </td>
          <td class="cell"><b>SHORT DAY, LONG YEAR</b><br><br>
            Saturn takes about 10.7 hours (no one knows precisely) to rotate on its axis once—a Saturn “day”—and 29 Earth years to orbit the sun.

            GAS GIANT
        </b><br><br>
        Saturn is a gas-giant planet and therefore does not have a solid surface like Earth’s. But it might have a solid core somewhere in there.
      </td>
          <td class="cell"><b>HOT AIR</b><br><br>
            Saturn's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He). </td>

           </b><br><br> Saturn has 53 known moons with an additional 29 moons awaiting confirmation of their discovery—that is a total of 82 moons.

        <tr>
       <td class="cell"><b>GLORIOUS RINGS</b><br><br>
        Saturn has the most spectacular ring system, with seven rings and several gaps and divisions between them. </td>

        RARE DESTINATION </b><br><br>
        Few missions have visited Saturn: Pioneer 11 and Voyagers 1 and 2 flew by; But Cassini orbited Saturn 294 times from 2004 to 2017.
      </td>
      <td class = "cell"><b>LIFELESS BEHEMOTH</b><br><br>
        Saturn cannot support life as we know it, but some of Saturn's moons have conditions that might support life.
