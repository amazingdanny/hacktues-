        <p class="LongText"> Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most
            distant planet in our solar system. <br><br>
            More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our 
solar system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before 
its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 
1846.
            <br> <br>
            NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close. It flew past
in 1989 on its way out of the solar system.

            Neptune is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were a large apple, Neptune would be the size of a basketball.
        </td>
          <td class="cell"><b>EIGHTH WANDERER</b><br><br>
            Neptune orbits our Sun, a star, and is the eighth planet from the Sun at a distance of about 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers).
        </td>
          <td class="cell"><b>SHORT DAY, LONG YEAR</b><br><br>
            Neptune takes about 16 hours to rotate once (a Neptunian day), and about 165 Earth years to orbit the sun (a Neptunian year).

        Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of molecular hydrogen, atomic helium and methane.

            Neptune has 14 known moons which are named after sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.

           Neptune has at least five main rings and four more ring arcs, which are clumps of dust and debris likely formed by the gravity of a nearby moon.

        Because of dwarf planet Plutoâ€™s elliptical orbit, Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun (and us) than Neptune is.
