        <p class="innfo">  Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin
            atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, 
            extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.<br><br>
             Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet
            where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
            <br> <br>
              Perseverance rover – the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another 
            world – touched down on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey traversing 
            293 million miles (472 million kilometers). The Ingenuity helicopter rode to Mars 
            attached to the belly of Perseverance.  Perseverance is one of three spacecraft 
            that arrived at Mars in 2021. The Hope orbiter from the United Arab Emirates 
            arrived on Feb. 9, 2021. China’s Tianwen-1 mission arrived on Feb. 10, 2021, and
            includes an orbiter, a lander, and a rover. Europa and India also have spacecraft
            studying Mars from orbit.
            <br> <br>
            In May 2021, China became the second nation to ever land successfully on Mars when
            its Zhurong Mars rover touched down. An international fleet of eight orbiters is studying
            the Red Planet from above including three NASA orbiters: 2001 Mars Odyssey, 
            Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and MAVEN. These robotic explorers have found lots of
            evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of 
            years ago.

          <td class = "cell"><b>SMALL PLANET</b><br><br>
            If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a dime, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet.
        </td>
          <td class="cell"><b>FOURTH ROCK</b><br><br>
            Mars orbits our Sun, a star. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun at an average distance of about 228 million km (142 million miles) or 1.52 AU.
        </td>
          <td class="cell"><b>LONGER DAYS</b><br><br>
            One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.

      STINKY CLOUDS</b><br><br>
      Venus is permanently shrouded in thick, toxic clouds of sulfuric acid that start at an altitude of 28 to 43 miles (45 to 70 kilometers). The clouds smell like rotten eggs!
      </td>
          <td class="cell"><b>DIVERSE TERRAIN</b><br><br>
      Venus has a solid surface covered in dome-like volcanoes, rifts, and mountains, with expansive volcanic plains and vast, ridged plateaus.</td>
          <td class="cell"><b>
      YOUTHFUL SURFACE</b><br><br>
      The average surface of Venus is less than a billion years old, and possibly as young as 150 million years old – which is relatively young from a geological perspective. This is a major conundrum for scientists – they don’t know exactly what happened that made Venus completely resurface itself.</td>  
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td class = "cell"><b>RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE</b><br><br>
      Venus’ thick atmosphere traps heat creating a runaway greenhouse effect – making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. The greenhouse effect makes Venus roughly 700°F (390°C) hotter than it would be without a greenhouse effect.</td>
       <td class="cell"><b>SPACECRAFT MAGNET</b><br><br>
      Venus was the first planet explored by a spacecraft and was intensely studied early in the history of space exploration. Venus was also the first planet whose surface was reached by a spacecraft from Earth. The intense heat means landers have only survived for a couple of hours.</td>
      <td class="cell"><b>
      BACKWARD SUNRISE</b><br><br>
      Venus rotates backward on its axis compared to most planets in our solar system. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east, opposite of what we see on Earth.
