    Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.
  The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable
  planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively 
  stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for 
  thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with
  Earth.
    Earth's Moon is the fifth largest of the 200+ moons orbiting planets in our 
  solar system.
    Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because people didn't know 
  other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting 
  Jupiter in 1610.
    NASA currently has three robotic spacecraft exploring the Moon â€“ Lunar Reconnaissance 
  Orbiter and the twin ARTEMIS spacecraft.
