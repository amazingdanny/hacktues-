          Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.
          The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable
          planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively 
          stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for 
          thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with
          Earth.
            <br> <br>
            Earth's Moon is the fifth largest of the 200+ moons orbiting planets in our 
  solar system.
            <br> <br>
            Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because people didn't know 
            other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting 
            Jupiter in 1610.
            <br><br>
            NASA currently has three robotic spacecraft exploring the Moon – Lunar Reconnaissance 
            Orbiter and the twin ARTEMIS spacecraft.

            If you set a single green pea next to a U.S. nickel, you'd have a pretty good idea of the size of the Moon compared to Earth.

          <td class="cell"><b>CONSTANT COMPANION</b><br><br>
            The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It goes around the Earth at a distance of about 239,000 miles (385,000 kilometers).
        </td>
          <td class="cell"><b>LOCKED UP</b><br><br>
            The Earth and Moon are tidally locked. Their rotations are so in sync we only see one side of the Moon. Humans didn't see the lunar far side until a Soviet spacecraft flew past in 1959.
